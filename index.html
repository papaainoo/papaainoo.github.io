        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello! I'm Godfred Amponsah, a Computing and Data professional with a Master's degree in Computer Information Systems and Data Analytics from West Texas A&M University. Currently, I am leveraging my data analytical skills in the rapidly evolving fields of Data Science, Data Engineering, Analytics, and AI.</p>
          <p>I also hold a Master's degree in Geotechnical Engineering, which equips me with the knowledge to use geospatial intelligence and analyze data from satellites. I take pride in my educational background, which significantly contributes to my work.</p>
            <p> My current and previous roles have allowed me to hone my leadership skills while guiding teams and collaborating with various departments and stakeholders to generate insights that are beneficial to organizations and solve problems. Additionally, I have developed databases to organize data efficiently helping organizations to reduce data redundancy, streamline data management processes and facilitate better decision making through improved data accessibility and availability.</p>
            <p>I had the privilege of sharing my knowledge and leading a team of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and data engineers to develop dashboards for an NGO working with US Military families. These dashboards help in providing retreats to improve family communications and overall family functioning.</p>
            <p>My passion for coding and computing began at a young age and has only intensified over time, with a particular focus on Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and Business Intelligence. My experience working in the technology divisions of multinational corporations has provided me with invaluable industry insights. As we witness the ever-growing integration of businesses and information technology, I am committed to leveraging my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business effectively.
